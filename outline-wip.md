Approach is to gradually build upon the familiar and not overload reader with dense textbook explanations prematurely

Assumptions: HS level math including basic linear algebra, logs, (basic trig?) & curiosity

Goals: understanding of functional programming principles, increased skill reading academic papers in the field

Will it help me pass...?
  * [AP® Computer Science A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf): The CSA Course is built on the Java Programming Language. This guide does not focus on any particular language, but the ones included are functional which does not include Java although it does have some functional aspects. The CSA Exam does not focus on those funnctional aspects, e.g. lambdas and higher order functions
  * [AP® Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf): It may help see how principles are translated to code in a functional language. If I were teaching the class I would like use Python as it is widely used in both university classrooms and industry and python notebooks are a clean way to document and share code.
  * [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/): Another maybe. CS50 takes the principles found in AP® Computer Science Principles and gets down to the nitty gritty of writing and analyzing code in the C programming language.

Mind-numbingly obvious facts you might have missed
* Inner product gets its name because it defines a vector in the direction between two vectors. Two orthogonal vector have an inner product of zero as there is no common direction.
